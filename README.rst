EO times series.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some mainly GEE related functions that I have used to that end. This has been to get the job done, I do not claim this collection of funcs to be efficient/the best way to do things, but is here in case it is of use. 

Installation and Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing the required libs (there are not many) uses the conda system so ensure you have this first. Clone this repo and cd into the directory then...

.. code-block:: bash

conda env create -f eot.yml

Or if you wish to wait for less time install mamba and...

.. code-block:: bash

mamba env create -f eot.yml

conda activate eot
